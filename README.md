# 👋 Hi, I'm Matías Tailler

### 🧑‍🏫 From English Teacher to Full-Stack Developer

I'm Matías, an English teacher with 15 years of experience, now taking on a new challenge in software development. I recently completed a full-stack JavaScript bootcamp at SoyHenry, where I specialized in backend development, and I’m passionate about creating efficient, scalable solutions. My journey combines a love for languages with a new fascination for programming languages and software architecture.
